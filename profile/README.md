## Fireline

The MITRE Fireline project is focused on bringing the two communities of AI researchers and fire science researchers together to tackle the ever-increasing problem of forest fires. Our project currently focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to create novel courses of action (COAs) against wildfires and has many tracks of development devoted to furthering this research:

* Reinforcement Learning
  - In Progress
* Simulation
  - [SimFire](https://github.com/mitrefireline/simfire)
* Dataset Curation
  - [BurnMD](https://fireline.mitre.org/burnmd)
